  "L20079":"<p>Main reasons for the strategy:<br />Quote:</p><ul><li>The right to work is a human right. This right means that every worker is entitled to a healthy and safe working environment. The promotion of wellbeing at work in all its aspects is primordial for protecting workers, for preserving their health and for ensuring they are motivated when doing their job.</li><li>The promotion of the wellbeing of workers offers added value to every individual company. Unhealthy and unsafe working conditions reduce productivity, which ultimately results in dismissals, closures and bankruptcies. Poor working conditions are also a form of unfair competition between businesses. And so, a lack of wellbeing at work is also a social-economic injustice.</li><li>Insufficient attention to wellbeing at work inevitably causes an increase in occupational health problems, which in turn has an impact on the expenditure of social security and social protection systems and so on the community as a whole. On the other hand, the promotion of wellbeing at work contributes to improving public health and the availability of workers in companies. As a result, the productivity and the competitiveness of companies is improved. This also has favourable consequences for the prosperity of our society as a whole.</li><li>A global approach to workers’ wellbeing does not end at the entrance to the plant: a healthy employee works better but vice versa healthy and safe working conditions will also improve overall health. As a result, several levels of authority are involved in the implementation of this global plan: the federal Minister for Employment, as well as the federal Minister of Social Affairs and Public Health, the Communities and the Regions. Consultation on various levels will thus be necessary, depending on the proposed actions.</li></ul>",

Decreasing work ability prevents the employee from participating in working life actively and for a long time.

Work-related health damages cause absence from work, causing expenses for the employee, employer, and society. Lack of awareness about occupational health and safety does not support the protection of the employee’s health in the work environment. Employers and employees do not know enough about occupational health and safety, their rights and obligations, requirements resulting from legislation, or workplace risks.

  "L20121":"<p>The strategy defines the objectives, focal areas and principles of developing the activity in the next few years.<br />Six focal areas or actions of occupational safety and health have been formed:</p><ol><li>Maintenance and promotion of work ability and functional capacity</li><li>Prevention of occupational accidents and diseases</li><li>Prevention of musculoskeletal disorders</li><li>Mental well-being at work</li><li>Coping at work</li><li>Job control</li></ol><p>Creating good work environments and well-being presupposes that people in the workplaces have adequate and proper knowledge, will and competence needed for reaching the goals. Improving well-being at work ultimately depends on the actions taken in the workplace. The first step in fulfilling the vision and reaching the objectives is that the workplaces meet the minimum requirements of legislation and get the basic conditions in order. The regional occupational safety and health administration is responsible for supervising that employers fulfil their <a href=\"https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/handle/10024/161451\" target=\"_blank\">statutory obligations</a>.<br /><strong>Focus Area 1: Leadership, the corner stone of well-being at work </strong><br />“The quality of leadership in enterprises and other organisations will be improved together with interest groups and by influencing training and instruction. The conditions mentioned in the vision of these policies – health, safety and well-being – generally belong to a good leadership. Leadership will be developed with the object of creating a better safety climate. Improved leadership can be achieved mainly by cooperation and communication”.<br /><strong> Focus Area 2: Occupational health care, an efficient partner</strong></p><p>“The preventive role of occupational health care will be strengthened. The impact of occupational health care will be appraised on the basis of occupational health care reports and by monitoring sickness absence rates, occupational accidents and occupational diseases. To promote and support employees’ work ability, models of early support will be put into practice at workplaces. Cooperation between the line management and experts for promoting health and work ability will be improved. Cooperation includes mutual awareness and common forms of action (e.g. workplace surveys, risk assessment expertise and early support to employees and management) as part of improving health and safety. Successful cooperation with occupational health care requires a smooth flow of information and awareness of the state of affairs”.<br /><strong>Focus Area 3: Knowledge, will and competence through cooperation </strong><br />“A form of network cooperation for the work environment and well-being at work will be created for the different parties and actors, who all recognize their roles and tasks in the network. This occupational safety and health network operates in a result-oriented and efficient way for the work environment and well-being at work. It will be ascertained that the cooperation is functional both on the national and regional level and in workplaces as well”.<br /><strong>Focus Area 4: Effectiveness through communication </strong><br />“Together with interest groups it will be investigated what kind of communication best corresponds to the needs and brings good results in different contexts. Communication will be intensified by using various means and channels”.<br /><strong>Focus Area 5: Good legislation, the foundation for the minimum level of working conditions </strong><br />“Occupational safety and health legislation will be prepared in close cooperation with labour market parties so as to make legislation up-to-date and meet the needs of working life. The up-to-dateness of decrees will be evaluated at least every fifth year and that of acts at least every tenth year from the date of entry into force. In the EU politics, Finland will support the efforts for simplifying directives and transferring the focus to the member states when this is possible without reducing the basic regulation, such as that on risk assessment and cooperation at workplaces”.<br /><strong>Focus Area 6: Competent occupational safety and health administration ensures enforcement of legislation </strong>“By developing enforcement practices and personnel’s competence, the occupational safety and health administration ensures that enforcement is effective, competent and has a uniform quality. Evaluation of the impact of enforcement will be developed and the effects of the different actions monitored. Feedback from workplaces will be monitored by means of client questionnaires”.<br /><strong>Additional info from other programmes </strong><br />Other programs related to Health and Safety at Work<br />The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health has set a goal to extend employees’ lifelong time at work by three years until the year 2020.

In order to broaden the scope as well as to increase impact for all work programmes cooperation with relevant partners shall be established.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Over the third period 50.000 companies &ndash; mainly SMEs &ndash; shall be supervised.</p>\r\n<p>Former GDA work programmes:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.gda-portal.de/EN/GDA/Work-Programmes/Work-Programmes_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Work Programmes 2013 &ndash; 2018</a>&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.gda-portal.de/DE/Downloads/pdf/Ergebnisse-AP-2008-2012.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3\" target=\"_blank\">Work Programmes 2008 &ndash; 2012</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><br><strong>Work Programme &quot;Musculoskeletal Loads (MSL)&quot;</strong><br>The work programme &quot;Musculoskeletal Loads&quot; (MSL) is implemented with a combination of information, advice and supervisory measures.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Information:</strong> Assistance and other risk assessment complement the core process, so that a broader impact can be achieved, beyond the (limited) number of site visits. In particular, with regard to the needs of SMEs, low-threshold access to the detection and assessment of types of stress at the level of coarse screening (checklist) or special screening (eg, key performance indicators) and examples of &quot;good practice&quot; for measures and impact assessments are essential. The assistance will thus create the conditions for the proper implementation of the entire process of risk assessment.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Inspections and advice:</strong> The core process in the third GDA period is regularly carried out by all GDA executives, above all as part of a system review of the occupational safety organization and risk assessment in companies with fewer than 250 employees. The work programme MSL provides for this inspection activity a technical data sheet or appropriate professional test items. On the other hand, the working programme MSL aims to integrate the issue of MSL sustainably as an integrated part of regular labour inspection action, with the focus on an appropriate risk assessment. Therefore, the working programme MSL would like to use the 3rd GDA period to further qualify and support the labour inspectorates for dealing with MSL in the context of the risk assessment.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Strengthening &quot;workplace health literacy&rdquo;:</strong> The MSL working programme takes up the results of the second GDA working programme on &ldquo;health literacy&rdquo; in the world of work and would like to cooperate with networks and partners from the social security institutions, the social partners and other institutions in order to implement measures of working conditions related prevention (situational prevention) aiming to complement behavioral prevention. The aim is, in particular, to strengthen the role of the management not only to establish appropriate working conditions related prevention (situational prevention), for example as part of the risk assessment, but also to influence the behavior of employees at the workplace so that measures of working conditions related prevention (situational prevention) at the workplace can be accepted and realised.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Measures of the partners:</strong>The work programme aims at networking with different networks and partners as part of the accompanying processes. Measures of the partners relate to:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The realisation of multiplier effects for tools and support of the GDA organisations, in order to improve the contact to the management and company multipliers (e.g. occupational safety experts or occupational physicians)&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>The contribution of own expertise and adequate supplementary offers (tools) for the target groups, eg for the strengthening of the organisational and individual health competence.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Work Programme &quot;Psyche&quot;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Recommendations for implementing psychosocial risk assessment:</strong> Since the end of 2013 the Safety and Health at Work Act explicitly calls for the consideration of psychological stress in risk assessments. In seven steps, a new brochure (see box on the right) explains the risk assessment of psychological strain, its methods and tools. Parameters are described within which the actual implementation of risk assessment is to move. The brochure is aimed particularly at companies and occupational safety actors (e.g. employers, works and staff councils, company physicians and specialists for occupational safety).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Practical tools for the workplace:</strong> The work programme collects examples of good practice for dealing with psychological stress in the workplace and makes them known to the public. Companies, workers and occupational safety and health experts receive practical support for the improvement of working conditions in everyday business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Qualification of inspectors:</strong> Inspectors from occupational health and safety authorities and accident insurance institutions are trained to identify mental stress and to adequately advise companies. By the end of the period, the entire inspection staff will have a basic knowledge about psychological stress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Inspections and advice</strong><strong>:</strong> Since the beginning of 2015, the inspection staff of the occupational safety and health authorities and accident insurers conducts coordinated inspections. The focus of the site inspections is the consideration of psychological stress in the risk assessment. The inspectors also advise businesses specifically on setting up working hours so as to promote health and on dealing with traumatic events in the workplace.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Work Programme &quot;Carcinogenic substances&quot;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Inspections and advice:&nbsp;</strong>As part of the core process of the working programme on &ldquo;Safe Handling of Carcinogenic Hazardous Substances&rdquo;, establishments where employees work with carcinogenic hazardous substances are to be visited by the labour inspectorates of the federal countries and the accident insurance institutions. The visit will be based on a single survey toolkit, the technical data sheet of the work programme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The core process shall be supported directly by the the accompanying process &quot;Hazardous Substance Check&quot;. The close connection of the Hazardous Substance Check as a directly supportive process of the core process should raise awareness of the particular dangers posed by carcinogenic hazardous substances in all relevant branches of industry and identify the need for action. The goal is to accelerate the use of this instrument by the companies. The results of the self-assessment carried out with the check can in particular, increase self-motivation to implement necessary changes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Practical tools for the workplace:</strong> Within the framework of the working programme &quot;Safe Handling of Carcinogenic substances&quot;, exemplary solutions for operational practice shall also be found and presented. Good practice examples shall be collected and presented with the help of an online module.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Activity Collaboration of institutions&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>The German strategy addresses with all its core elements the collaboration of institutions (work programmes, cooperation on inspection activities, development of a coherent set of rules).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Federal states and public accident insurance institutions hand in hand: the Joint German Occupational Safety and Health Strategy (GDA) provides the framework. As part of the GDA, state occupational safety and health authorities and public accident insurance institutions have undertaken to adopt a work-sharing and coordinated approach in advising and supervising companies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This approach aims at coordination, standardisation and transparency in consultancy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Key tools of the joint consultancy and supervisory strategy are:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Framework agreements on the interaction of the state occupational safety and health authorities and the public accident insurance institutions&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Joint guidelines for coordinated, tactical supervisory action and equivalent implementation of occupational safety and health regulations&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Promotion of data and information exchange between the federal states and the public accident insurance institutions on company inspections.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Furthermore, the &bdquo;Occupational Safety and Health Forum&ldquo; was established under the German Strategy. Its task is to ensure early and active participation of the expert representatives of the umbrella organisations of the employers and workers, the professional and industrial associations, science, the health and pension insurance funds, institutions in the sector of safety and health at work as well as bodies which help to promote employability in the development and updating of the Joint German OSH Strategy.</p>\r\n<p><br><strong>&nbsp;Activity Optimisation of rules and regulations</strong><br><strong>Statutory regulations are the basis for implementing and evaluating occupational safety and health measures.</strong></p>\r\n<p>One important requirement for the effective implementation of occupational safety and health regulations is that they are practicable, consistent and, above all, easily manageable by the users and self-explanatory. The German government, federal states and public accident insurance institutions set themselves the task under the Joint German Occupational Safety and Health Strategy of optimising the rules and regulations relating to safety and health at work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One important module is the guideline paper on the restructuring of the set of rules and regulations in occupational safety and health passed in August 2011. The guideline paper defines the relationship of state law to autonomous law of the public accident insurance institutions and describes the procedures with which the two areas of law are harmonised.</p>\r\n<p><br><strong>Activity Improvement of the cooperation and coordination of the actions of the public occupational safety and health authorities and accident insurance funds&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><br>The occupational safety and health authorities and accident insurance institutions have undertaken to adopt a work-sharing and coordinated approach in advising and supervising companies.

That requires a sufficient quantity and quality of labour inspectors and other employees of bodies supervising OSHP. Language skills, English in particular, are also necessary<br />The performance of labour inspections and state supervision over OSHP must be intensified and its quality must be improved to the level of standards achieved in the EU Member States<br />The effective use of existing financial, technical and personnel resources of the state inspection bodies and supervisory organs should be achieved by better coordination and the gradual creation of conditions for the suitable institutional integration of present inspection and supervisory organs. <br /><strong>Priority 3: Improving the quality of activities of specialized subjects eligible to perform activities in the area of OSHP </strong><br />According to legal requirements, small and medium-sized organizations which do not have their own experts in the area of OSHP are obliged to fulfil certain obligations in the area of OSHP; these tasks are frequently ensured through outsourced/supply companies which are authorized to perform activities related to preventative and protective services (safety technical service, occupational health service). <br />As a result, labour inspectorates and public health authorities must intensively verify the quality of services and carry out controls in these companies focused on the professional qualifications of their employees and the quality and professional standards of their methods. <br /><strong> Priority 4: Applying system approach to OSHP-related issues </strong><br />Fulfilling the obligations in the area of OSHP is often insufficient, especially among small and medium-size employers and the level of legal awareness is low. It has been demonstrated that the application of a system approach to OSHP and its verification by an independent third party will increase the level of OSHP among individual subjects. In addition to the OSHP management system pursuant to the OHSAS 18 001 standard, the level of protection of employees in organizations in Slovakia can be verified through the Safe Enterprise project implemented by the National Labour Inspectorate (hereinafter referred to as the “NLI”). <br /><strong>Priority 5: The Focus of attention on sectors with a high number of occupational accidents and diseases </strong><br />Prevention, monitoring, punitive and repressive activities of the labour inspection and other state OSH institutions will focus on sectors and jobs with a higher incidence of health damage.</p>",

This means engaging everyone who shares the responsibility for helping Great Britain work well, because they have a vital role in managing risk and preventing damage to individuals, businesses and the economy. <br />Across each nation, region or sector, we need collective ownership that best reflects local circumstances. The regulators will retain their key roles, providing targeted advice and guidance for key audience groups and taking enforcement action when and where necessary.

Positive outcomes can include reduced sickness absence, lower costs and a good reputation. Promoting this compelling business case should help even more businesses to make the most of the many benefits a good health and safety culture can bring. Sharing examples of practice, supported by targeted, relevant advice and information will allow the system to set a common understanding of what proportionate health and safety looks like.

Working together, much has already been done to help small businesses, but there are opportunities to work smarter. Already many large businesses and intermediaries have developed efficient supply chains and productive relationships by working with and supporting small businesses. Many organisations also provide free help and support to SMEs outside their supply chains through cross-sector initiatives. <br />For SMEs, managing workplace risks shouldn’t be complicated or costly. Making support available which is quick and easy for small businesses to understand, so that they can fulfil their obligations, remains a challenge for all sectors. It will also be important to identify who the key influencers are for SMEs, working with them to raise awareness levels about the peer and expert support that is out there”. <br /><strong> Strategic theme 5: <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/strategy/keeping-pace-with-change.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Keeping pace with change</a>: Anticipating and tackling new health and safety challenges </strong><br />Quote: <br />“Great Britain leads the world in anticipating and tackling the new health and safety challenges that come with social, economic and technological change. <br />This ability to horizon scan, when combined with the deep knowledge and unrivalled expertise of the system, means that anticipating new health and safety challenges is an area where Great Britain can play a leading role, for example through HSE’s world-leading research capabilities. They are already being put to use helping Great Britain, as well as countries around the world, to improve health and safety, as well as better business outcomes. <br />To remain a world leader in risk management, Great Britain needs to develop high-quality capability, anticipating the workplace challenges of tomorrow and using the flexibility of our goal-setting approach to solve them in ways that enable innovation and the use of new technologies. <br />Tackling the problems of tomorrow today is a responsible investment that protects workers, enables new and different approaches and provides the new knowledge, skills and expertise Great Britain can share internationally.” <br /><strong> Strategic theme 6: <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/strategy/sharing-our-success.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Sharing our success</a>: Promoting the benefits of Great Britain’s world-class health and safety system </strong><br />Quote: <br />“Everyone can take pride in Great Britain’s world-class reputation for health and safety and promote its success at home and abroad.

In this context, the focus in the next period should be on improving the work of prevention services which are the most direct contributors to the working conditions of every workplace.

  "L20537":"Successfully reaching SMEs is and continues to be a weak point. Implementation is good when there are large in-house preventive services; in SMEs, however, risk assessment poses problems and the number of visits by external services to SMEs is unsatisfactory. ‘Emerging risks’ such as psychosocial stress and MSDs are increasing in all enterprises and are not being adequately countered by the Directives.",
  "L20538":"Good organisation of OSH management has been ensured in most large and medium-sized enterprises. The micro and small enterprises and a percentage of the medium-sized ones are experiencing difficulties in this respect, due to the fact that they have no established traditions, that the employers do not possess sufficient managerial experience and that they are not well informed about the labour legislation and the requirements for safety and health at work.",
  "L20539":"The practical difficulties encountered in ensuring that the directives achieve their aims relate to the inability of small businesses to comply with the requirements of the directives, due to the lack of know-how, equipment, appropriate means, suitably qualified staff, and capital. In addition, small businesses fail to provide sufficient documentation of the measures taken to ensure the compliance of employers with the relevant legislation. One example is the lack of appropriate risk assessment reporting and the absence of equipment maintenance documents, accident records and personnel training.",
  "L20540":"The information available indicates that small and medium-sized enterprises have no difficulties in meeting the requirements set out in applicable legislation stemming from the relevant Directives. Any difficulties that small and medium- sized enterprises do face have no basis in the Directives, as these lay down only minimum standards.",
  "L20541":"The federal state supervisory authorities found that Directives with insufficiently detailed targets cause problems for SMEs. As the OSH Directives allow latitude for interpretation, the type and scope of precautions caused difficult discussions in  some  cases.  Employers  often  ask  if  and  when  and  to  what  extent  the provisions of the Directives are binding in other EU Member States. Often SMEs have no overview of the transposition of the OSH Directives into national law, in terms of scope, complexity and application in selected areas. Often SMEs do not have well-trained OSH officers. There is little acceptance of the cost and time needed to implement OSH provisions. Compared with large companies and groups, SMEs generally have to pay handsomely for advice from experienced OSH experts. This makes it difficult and costly for SMEs to implement OSH standards. The DGB also complains of inadequate implementation of OSH obligations in SMEs, which it ascribes in part to inadequate specification in OSH rules or to inadequate supervision by the competent authorities.",

  "L20549":"A frustration among many small firms is that there appears to be little synergy between the current implementation of directives.

  "L20556":"Difficulties in following the requirements of Directives regarding health and safety of workers in SMEs are linked primarily with a lack of sufficient financial resources for the performance of obligations in respect of health and safety at work. Furthermore, in accordance with applicable provisions, employers who employ up to 100 workers are not obliged to create a health and safety at work service. (They can entrust the performance of health and safety at work tasks to a staff member already carrying out another job, or - in the event of absence of competent workers - to external specialists). As a result, at such employers premises some duties in the field of health and safety at work are not performed or their performance is not satisfactory.",

  "L20559":"During the investigations that have been carried out, small undertakings have, among other things, reported a lack of time for work environment management and a perception of the regulations as being complicated. The Swedish Work 22 (31) Environment Authority has found, through its inspections, some major shortcomings in knowledge of work environment management among small and medium-sized enterprises.",
  "L20560":"Substantive reasons for these problems, besides the current economic crisis, include the following factors: - they lack funding and do not have resources set aside to keep equipment in a safe and working condition, or to verify the safety of work equipment or other facilities used; - they do not employ their own occupational safety and health specialists, instead hiring external technical safety services; - it is up to them to choose a quality business authorised to provide safety technical services (they do not always select a quality outfit).",
  "L20561":"Note: Comment is from q2.8: We can summarise, from the annual reports on the work of the Labour Inspectorate, that employers are too frequently unaware of the importance of ensuring health and safety at work; this applies in particular to those employers who entrust all health and safety at work tasks to outside contractors. When they sign contracts with an outside contractor, employers often seem to believe that they have done everything required to ensure health and safety at work.",

It aims to provide up-to-date online information for all interested parties and stakeholders about the status of OSH in the European Union.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The overall objective of this activity is to design and develop a reliable and stable information system on OSH in Europe, based on data from the relevant national and European data providers. From 2016 to 2018, two contractors of DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (Kooperationsstelle Hamburg IFE and Eurogip) developed the structure of the system, collected data for a selected number of indicators and assessed their reliability.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>EU-OSHA will contribute to the establishment and maintenance of the <strong>OSH BAROMETER</strong> by designing and running the data visualisation tool, ensuring data quality in cooperation with key data providers and stakeholders, and feeding in the quantitative and qualitative data in close collaboration with EU institutions and Member State Contact Points. As part of its activity <strong>‘EU OSH INFO System’</strong>, EU-OSHA will publish an analytical report, based on the collected data, every 3 years.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>OSH BAROMETER&nbsp;</strong>uses the following data sources:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Eurostat: data on economy, sectors, population, and employment</li>\r\n  <li>Eurostat: Labour Force Survey (LFS), particularly the ad hoc module from 2013: ‘Accidents at work and other work-related health problems’</li>\r\n  <li>Eurostat: European Union Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC)</li>\r\n  <li>Eurofound: European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS)</li>\r\n  <li>EU-OSHA: European Survey of Enterprises’ New and Emerging Risks (ESENER) 2014</li>\r\n  <li>European Commission, DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion: several reports and studies</li>\r\n  <li>Senior Labour Inspectors Committee (SLIC): non-confidential country evaluations</li>\r\n  <li>National contact points in Member States: national data and descriptions</li>\r\n  <li>EU-OSHA focal points/EU-OSHA: descriptions of the national OSH Systems in OSHwiki</li>\r\n  <li>comprehensive reports from national or European sources</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This methodology contains a compilation of all references and data sources that were used to provide texts, diagrams and tables, and in some cases additional explanations.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In most cases we provide the following data:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>the indicator and diagram/table/description title</li>\r\n  <li>a short description of the data evaluation and visualisation approach</li>\r\n  <li>exact source with name and link</li>\r\n  <li>the period of reference (year/period) and the last update</li>\r\n  <li>the coverage of Member States and other countries</li>\r\n  <li>filter options or selection criteria of the source</li>\r\n  <li>the measuring unit</li>\r\n  <li>any calculation that EU-OSHA performed based on the original data</li>\r\n  <li>visualisation basics</li>\r\n  <li>other useful explanations and additional comments</li>\r\n</ul>",

  "L22430":"<p>Since the introduction of French Law No 46-2426 of 30 October 1946, occupational risk insurance has been incorporated into the assignments of the French social security system. In addition to providing compensation, the social security bodies also have a risk prevention mission. <br />Occupational accidents and diseases are insured collectively by companies. Contribution rates depend on the size of the establishment, its sector of activity, and the frequency and seriousness of the accidents or diseases from which its employees may suffer. The compensation mission consists of meeting the needs of the victims by bearing the costs incurred by victims of occupational accidents and diseases, by reimbursing treatment expenses, and by paying daily allowances and pensions, annuities or lump sums in the event of permanent disability.<br />The CNAMTS is an administrative national public establishment overseen by the Social Security Directorate. Its responsibilities and missions are specified in particular by French Law No 2004-810 of 13 August 2004. The activities of the CNAMTS consist, in particular, of the following:</p><ul><li>Defining the focuses, principles and objectives that guide CNAMTS’ action and the action of the French National Health Insurance Scheme for salaried workers (the general social security scheme, or Assurance Maladie), and ensuring that they are implemented.</li><li>Defining and promoting the prevention of diseases, and occupational accidents and diseases by taking effective national action.</li><li>Determining and coordinating the activities of the bodies of the network of health insurance branches and occupational accidents and diseases branches: regional and local health insurance funds (caisses primaires d'assurance maladie), Occupational Health and Pension Insurance Funds (Caisses d’Assurance Retraite et de la Santé au Travail), the regional health insurance fund of the Paris region (Caisse Régionale d’Assurance Maladie d’Île de France), and the general social security funds for French overseas territories (Caisses Générales de la Sécurité Sociale). These local and regional health insurance funds particularly have the mission of assisting companies in assessing the risks of occupational accidents and diseases, with a view to preventing those risks, and the mission of helping to price insurance for occupational accidents and diseases. They advise companies on their risk prevention approach through direct action in the workplace. They also act through collective actions with various trade sectors, designing risk assessment and risk prevention systems, offering training, disseminating good practices and distributing financial incentives.</li></ul><p>The Occupational Accidents and Diseases Commission (Commission des Accidents du Travail et des Maladies Professionnelles) is in charge of balancing the finances of the Occupational Accidents and Diseases (AT/MP) Branch with regard to pricing, compensation, and the prevention of occupational accidents and diseases.

Authorised insurers are individuals or companies working under the terms of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FSA maintains a register of authorised insurers. Employers must be insured for at least GBP 5 million . However, the amount of insurance cover depends on risks and liabilities specific to the business/organisation. In practice, most insurers offer cover of at least GBP 10 million. When a policy is taken out or renewed, the insurer provides a certificate of employers’ liability insurance. This must clearly state the minimum level of cover provided and the companies covered by the policy. The employer must display a copy of the certificate of insurance where their employees can easily read it.<br />The HSE enforces the law on employers’ liability insurance, and HSE inspectors can check that an employer has employers’ liability insurance with an approved insurer for at least GBP 5 million. The inspectors may also ask to see the certificate of insurance and other insurance details. If an employer does not have suitable insurance, they can be fined up to GBP 2,500 for any day that they are without insurance.

  "L23341":"<p>The Labour Inspectorate performs state supervision over compliance with the requirements of legislation regulating labour relations and health and safety at work. Supervision is exercised by different inspection activities, the main ones being general, target or follow-up inspection. In the course of a general inspection visit, compliance with legal acts regulating occupational health and safety and organisation of working and rest time is monitored. The main focus is on the assessment of work environment situation of the enterprise and the employer’s activity in organising the work environment.</p><p>The aim of the inspection is to ensure safer working conditions, obtain information on the compliance of enterprises with legal acts, and resulting from the assessment, the working environment situation as a whole in the Republic is analysed.</p><p>In the course of a target inspection visit, compliance with the requirements of specific legal acts is monitored. A more specific sector is focused in the case of an enterprise with one or different fields of activity. A target inspection visit can also be motivated by information submitted to the Labour Inspectorate on non-compliance with occupational health and safety requirements, diagnosing work-related diseases, occurrence of an accident at work or hazardous work. In the course of a follow-up inspection, elimination of earlier detected infringements is monitored at the enterprise. In the course of inspection of a new or reconstructed building, the conformity of work environment with the requirements of health and safety at work is monitored. Such inspections are carried out at the request of a local government and in cases when the employer has notified the Labour Inspectorate of the commencement of activities or change of the field of activity. One of the responsibilities of the Labour Inspectorate is to carry out market supervision of personal protective equipment to be supplied. During the inspection, the compliance of personal protective equipment with requirements is checked with the aim of preventing placing on the market and taking into use of unsuitable personal protective equipment. The Occupational Health and Safety Act provides labour inspectors with several rights for carrying out supervision, including the right to enter the work place to be inspected with the aim of performing inspection activity (if necessary, also unannounced), receive information necessary for inspection, examine relevant documents, receive copies of them free of charge or have them made on the spot, and in the case of suspicion of misdemeanour, take along documents, require audit measurements of the working environment, take pictures and samples of materials and substances to be analysed, interview the employer, work environment representative, work environment specialist and workers alone or in the presence of witnesses and issue a notice with the purpose of terminating the infringement of requirements of legal acts and eliminating the consequences of the infringements.</p><p>The Labour Inspectorate together with other state authorities – Health Board, National Institute for Health Development, Rescue Board, Consumer Protection Inspectorate, Technical Regulatory Authority, Road Administration, Tax and Customs Board – form a national structure protecting good health of the population of Estonia. The budget of these authorities is regulated similarly as the budgets of all authorities financed from state budget – in order to achieve the objectives specified in the strategies of different fields, resources are planned in the State Budget Strategy, in turn providing the basis for annual State Budget.</p><p>The Labour Inspectorate cooperates with Health Board and National Institute for Health Development, in order to support the national objective of extending the healthy age of the people, and the cooperation much concerns information and supervision activities needed for the prevention of occupational diseases and disorders caused by work and research of occupational diseases. The Labour Inspectorate cooperates with Rescue Board, Consumer Protection Inspectorate, Technical Regulatory Authority, Road Administration and Tax and Customs Board mainly within the framework of ensuring healthy and safe work environment and supervision of labour relations.</p>",

After a visit to a company, consultants draft a written report and send it to the employer. The report includes proposals and recommendations. Proposals concern bringing work environment into conformity. Recommendations concern the situations, which are not directly violations of a legal act, but where certain fields of occupational health and safety can be organised better, based on good practice.</p>",
  "L23343":"Proceeding from the EU Strategic Framework on health and safety at work, in 2016-2020 more attention is paid to counseling, training and involvement of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, because their awareness and possibilities to contribute to occupational health and safety are often limited.

A similar situation also arises in ships flying with the flag of a foreign country, but located in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania. In this case, for instance when investigating the accident, which took place on board, the SLI inspectors require the consent of the ship's captain to access to ship.</p><p>Another difficulty for the SLI inspectors in exercising their duties is the reluctance of people (witnesses, victims and so on) to cooperate.
